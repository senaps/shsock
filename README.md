# shsock [Senaps Html Socket test]

very simple and quick way to test my socket backends. we will only set the 
namespace, and the event. we can then send messages to the socket server or
`console.log` incoming messages.
`socket.io.js.txt` is for when there is no DNS access :) not included in the 
code directly.
